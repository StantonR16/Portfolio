# Reflection / development


When I typically write code, I have a good idea of how I'll logistically implement the code. I tend to write a "rough draft" of the code, then later refine it; I usually don't write pseudocode. I also ensure my code runs as a *system* and everything works interdependently so future refactoring can be done efficiently.

<details><summary><strong>See more</strong></summary>

Most of the pride I have as a programmer comes from the code I write outside of class. All of these projects I made independently. Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

- My most recent project is my C# library, [RazorSharp](https://github.com/Decimation/RazorSharp).

	- I also wrote a [few articles](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1254217/Calculating-Heap-Size-of-Managed-Objects) on the code I wrote documenting .NET internals.

	- This specific code snippet uses pointer manipulation and pointer arithmetic which helped me understand pointers. To summarize the function, it returns the memory address of the raw data of an object in dynamic heap memory.

	```C#
	[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
	public static Pointer<byte> AddressOfHeap<T>(ref T t) where T : class
	{
		TypedReference tr = __makeref(t);

		// NOTE:
		// Strings have their data offset by RuntimeHelpers.OffsetToStringData
		// Arrays have their data offset by IntPtr.Size * 2 bytes (may be different for 32 bit)
		return **(IntPtr**) (&tr);
	}
	```       

- Around April 2018, I started writing my C triangle solver for the TI-84: [TITrig](https://github.com/Decimation/TITrig). This project taught me a lot about assembly, specifically Zilog Z80 assembly, and native programming.

- I also made a Schoology quiz taker in November 2017 using Selenium and C#: [QuizletSharp](https://github.com/Decimation/QuizletSharp). I'm in the process of rewriting this library because my skills have increased significantly since I first wrote it. Ironically, the program is actually very fast. This is a code snippet that resolves the current question and attempts to find the closest answer.

	```C#
	public void LongMode()
	{
		Stopwatch localSw = Stopwatch.StartNew();

		Console.Clear();
		_numOfQuestions = GetQuestionAmount();
		Console.WriteLine("Total questions: {0}", _numOfQuestions);

		for (int i = 0; i < _numOfQuestions; i++) {
			_currentQuestion = i;
			string prompt = GetPromptAtQuestionNum(i);

			List<IWebElement> radios = GetRadiosAtQuestionNum(i);
			LogQuestion("Indexed {0} radios in this scope", radios.Count);


			string def;

			if (Manual.ContainsKey(prompt)) {
				def = Manual[prompt];
				goto skipPool;
			}

			try {
				def = _qp.Pool[prompt];
			}
			catch (KeyNotFoundException) {
				// Run advanced search if key is not found

				LogQuestion("Key not found!");
				def = FindClosestDelta(prompt);
			}
	...
	```

- My first significant project was my [Cydia repository](https://github.com/Decimation/decimation.github.io) for jailbroken iOS devices which I made in 8th grade. It has served as a template for many GitHub-based Debian APT package management repositories.

- For my class-based accomplishments, I learned a lot about Processing (which I honestly dislike) and drawing methods. It has helped me visually channel my creativity. You can also use the arrows below to see some of the projects I made in class

# Difficulty

Writing code in Processing that actually worked *on the web* was a huge pain, because Processing JS converts Processing Java code into Processing JS code on the web which meant some Java code wouldn't work properly. For example, `enums` don't work on the web. 

In nearly every Processing project I did, I ended up writing some code that didn't work on the web. To resolve this, I would have to rewrite a major part of the program just to get it to work on the web. That's one major reason I dislike Processing.

# My favorite languages

1. `C#`
2. `C++`
3. `Java`
4. `C`

  - I liked learning how to draw even more advanced things in Processing. I came up with a cool method for moving stars:
 
```Java
void move(double angleDelta) {
    m_color = color((int)(Math.cos(m_angle) * 255),(int)(Math.sin(m_angle) * 255),(int)(Math.tan(m_angle) * 255));
    m_x = Math.cos(m_angle) * m_scalar + (m_x);
    m_y = Math.sin(m_angle) * m_scalar + (m_y);
    m_angle += angleDelta;
  }
```

- Basically, this code does some epic trigonometric and sinusoidal calculations which move the star. This code actually wasn't hard at all (because SOH-CAH-TOA is epic), but relatively speaking it was hard to visualize the calculations.

- This assignment was extremely frustrating because my code worked on desktop but not online *(as does every single Processing project)*. Specifically, my syllable counter was originally done with Regex but Processing is stupid and Regex doesn't work online. I ended up having to write my syllable counter in a less efficient manner. I had to write the syllable counter a total of 3 times before it actually worked.

- I learned a lot about data structures this year. I already knew about Sets, Maps, and LinkedLists, but I learned a lot about Queues and Stacks. I had never used Queues and Stacks before because I never needed to use a structure like them. I think my knowledge will help me write more efficient and effective code because I will know which structure I need to use and how to apply its use.
